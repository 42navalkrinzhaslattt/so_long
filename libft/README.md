# libft
The "libft" repository is a comprehensive collection of utility functions and libraries written in C. The repository contains three main components:

Libft Functions:
This section of the repository contains a set of custom implementations of fundamental functions found in the C standard library. These functions cover a wide range of operations, including string manipulation, memory management, linked list operations, character checking, and more.

ft_printf:
The "ft_printf" module within the repository is an implementation of the printf function, extending its capabilities with additional format specifiers and flags. Developers can use this custom printf implementation to format and print text with enhanced features, including support for the standard csdipxX% conversions and various formatting flags.

get_next_line function:
The "get_next_line" function is designed to read a line from a file descriptor, providing a convenient and efficient way to read input from various sources. This function is particularly useful for handling input from files, network sockets, or other input streams, allowing developers to read data line by line.
